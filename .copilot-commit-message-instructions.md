# Professional Commit Message Guidelines

## Format
Follow the conventional commit format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types
- **feat**: New feature or functionality
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code formatting, missing semi colons, etc. (no code change)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without adding features or fixing bugs
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes
- **build**: Build system or dependency changes

## Guidelines

### Subject Line
- Keep it under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Use lowercase except for proper nouns
- Don't end with a period
- Be concise but descriptive

### Body
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how
- Use imperative mood
- Separate from subject with a blank line

### Footer
- Reference issues with format: `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
- Add breaking changes with format: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`

## Examples

### Good Examples
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implement automatic token refresh to improve user experience
by preventing session timeouts during active usage.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): handle null values in user profile

Prevents application crashes when profile data is incomplete
by adding proper null checks and default values.

Fixes #456
```

```
refactor(database): optimize query performance

Replace N+1 queries with batch operations to reduce
database load from 500ms to 50ms.

BREAKING CHANGE: Updated query interface to use batch operations
```

### Bad Examples
```
fixed bug
```
```
Added new stuff to the auth system
```
```
feat: a lot of changes to many different parts of the system
```

## Additional Rules
- One commit per logical change
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write self-explanatory commit messages
- Consider future readers when writing messages
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Be consistent with existing commit history
